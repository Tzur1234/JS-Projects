#Mail
In this project I have design a front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.
the app based on Django framework.

The follow feuters: get mail, send mail, and update emails , was complited by using this applicationâ€™s API.

* Send Mail : User can send new email to a user (who has also sighn the app)
* Mailbox :  When a user visits their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive,  the appropriate mailbox is being loaded.
Each email is rendered in its own box that displays who the email is from, what the subject line is, and the timestamp of the email. If the email is unread, it should appear with a white background. If the email has been read, it should appear with a gray background.

* View Email: When a user clicks on an email, the user is taken to a view where they see the content of that email.Once the email has been clicked on,  the email is marked as read.

* Archive and Unarchive:  users can to archive and unarchive emails that they have received.
* Reply: users can reply to an email.
