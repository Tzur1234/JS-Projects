#loanClaculator#

In this project I have build a loanCalculator. 
It takes 3 parameters : the amount of loan , the interest and the number of years to return the loan

I learned about:
1. How to add elements + error messages and how to remove them after a set of time 
2, How to use 'insertBefore' function
3. How to extract value from input elements and how to insert value into them
4. How to use setTimeout function in order to run a function aftter a specific amount of time

- all of the project was focused on the DOM object
