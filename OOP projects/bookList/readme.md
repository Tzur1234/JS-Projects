# booklist - ES5

in this project I have built an application that add each givven task
to table. Unlike tasks list, this project I have used class to represent the book details and and store all the functions that reponsible for the UI in UI object

The UI object has several prototype, each of them has a function
- UI.prototype.showAlert    show alert (error or success)
- UI.prototype.deleteInput  to delete input fields for each submition
- UI.prototype.addBook      that responsible for adding new book to the table

The main goal of this project is to practice the usage of classes with ES5

# bookList - ES6
I have wrote the same app but this time i use the ES6 with make the usage of classes more comfortable and simple.
